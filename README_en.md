# About Creating My Webpage in Under 24 Hours

> This is a story of AI-empowered practice.

## üöÄ Preamble

This project documents how I built a personal webpage's front-end from scratch in **less than 24 hours**, leveraging the generative UI tool **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)** by Vercel and the AI-native code editor **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)**.

The successful completion of this project would not have been possible without the dedicated guidance and help of **[@Zhaohan-Wang]**, who not only pointed me in the right direction but also answered many of my questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

The entire development process was heavily reliant on AI tools to rapidly translate ideas into code. The workflow was as follows:

1.  **UI Prototype Generation (v0.dev)**
    * Described the desired webpage layout, components, and design style to `v0.dev` using natural language (prompts).
    * Iterated with the AI in real-time to adjust the UI until a satisfactory base version was achieved.

2.  **Code Initialization and Download**
    * Downloaded the complete Next.js project generated by `v0.dev`, which provided a high-quality starting point for local development.

3.  **AI-Assisted Editing and Content Filling (Cursor)**
    * Opened the project in the `Cursor` editor. With the help of its powerful AI chat and codebase-aware features, I efficiently completed the following tasks:
        * **Content Filling**: Added personal introductions, project experiences, and other text.
        * **Asset Integration**: Imported and displayed personal images and videos within the code.
        * **Fine-Tuning**: Modified component styles and adjusted layouts to achieve the final personalized effect.
